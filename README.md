## Purpose of this App

The main purpose of this Android app is to set reminders for users such that they are reminded of any important tasks a user sets for themselves.

## Functions of the App

This app is able to create new reminders for the current day and the next day that will carry over if they are not completed.
It also has functionality so that users can add reminders that are pending and can be moved to the current or next day depending 
on when the user wants to finish them.
Further, there are recurring reminders that can be set to appear daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly and can start on a specific date.
Each reminder now also has a context from Home, Work, School, and Errands and a focus mode which allows a user to only see reminders of that context.
The current list is displayed at the top either today, tomorrow, pending, or recurring and the today and tomorrow lists have the day of the week and the 
date displayed as well.
Users can also finish and unfinish reminders in the today and tomorrow lists where finished reminders get moved to after all unfinished reminders.
Users can remove reminders from the pending and recurring lists by a long hold and deleting them.
From the pending list, users can finish a reminder which will move it to the finished section of the current day's reminders.

## Velocity Calculations for Milestone 2
Iteration 1:
- Completed PRs: US6 (4), US7 (4), US9 (2), US10 (3), US11 (5), Developer Stories (2)
- 20 hours of work / 36 working hours = **0.56 velocity**
- Work not in PRs but progress was made
- Close to target velocity (0.6)

Iteration 2:
- Developer Stories (7), US8 (5), US12 (5), US14 (4), US15 (3)
- 24 hours of work / 36 working hours = **0.67 velocity**
- Less hours of work b/c work done in I1
- Basically target velocity
