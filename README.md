# Team 9 - Successorator

## Purpose of this App

The main purpose of this Android app is to set reminders for users such that they are reminded of any important tasks a user sets for themselves for the day.

## Functions of the App

This app is able to create new reminders for the day that can carry over to the next day if they are not completed.
Further, the reminders are also able to be crossed off on the day that they are completed and any finished tasks are not
rolled over to the next day.
If a user accidentally crosses off a task they did not mean to or they realize they did not fully complete a task, the user can
also move finished tasks back into the unfinished tasks list.
The current date is also displayed at the top so that the user can see what day it is and know what tasks they have for that day.
